# Introduction to version:

The Version determines the size and complexity of the QR code. 

Version numbers range from 1 to 40, and version 1 is a matrix of 21x21, with each additional version number increasing the size of the matrix by 4 modules (unit cells), so version 40 is a matrix of 177x177. 

The higher the version, the more data the QR code can store, but at the same time it needs more space to display or print.
